## Neuroinformatics Tutorial

**Work in progress**

This repository will host slide presentations for a tutorial on neuroinformatics resources for computational modellers. 

This was initially developed by Padraig Gleeson and Andrew Davison as part of a tutorial at [CNS 2017 in Antwerp](http://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2017-workshops). It is intended to be developed as a resource for the wider community.

In its initial form it will focus on neuroinformatics resources which may be of use for those **creating and analysing computational models of neuronal systems**, i.e. accessing the raw experimental data to constrain models, tools for model creation and analysis, databases of models, etc. Neuroinformatics of course has a much wider scope (databases of gene expression in neuronal systems, neuroimaging, etc.) and this tutorial can potentially be expanded in future.
