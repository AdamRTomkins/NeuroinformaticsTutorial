## Neuroinformatics Tutorial

**Work in progress!!**

This repository will host slide presentations for a tutorial on neuroinformatics resources for computational modellers. 

*This was initially developed by [Padraig Gleeson](https://github.com/pgleeson) and [Andrew Davison](https://github.com/apdavison) as part of a tutorial at [CNS 2017 in Antwerp](http://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2017-tutorials). It is intended to be developed as an open resource for the wider community. In its initial form it will focus on neuroinformatics resources which may be of use for those **creating and analysing computational models of neuronal systems**, i.e. accessing the raw experimental data to constrain models, tools for model creation and analysis, databases of models, etc. Neuroinformatics of course has a much wider scope (databases of gene expression in neuronal systems, neuroimaging, etc.) and this tutorial can potentially be expanded in future.*

### Summary
 
Neuroinformatics resources are becoming an essential part of computational investigations in neuroscience. A movement towards making data and software freely available to the community means that more and more experimental datasets, general purpose analysis tools and infrastructure for computational modelling and simulation are available for computational neuroscientists to help build, constrain and validate their models. 
 
This tutorial will give an overview of the range of neuroinformatics resources currently available to the community. The first part will give a brief introduction to a number of these under the headings; **Experimental datasets; Structured data from literature; Analysis tools; Simulation environments; Model sharing; Computing infrastructure; Open source initiatives**. 

The second half of the tutorial will involve hands on exercises where multiple resource will be accessed, data transformed and analysed and new models executed. Note that this tutorial will focus on neuroinformatics resources for cell and network modelling, and not cover the wide range of neuroimaging or genetics databases.
